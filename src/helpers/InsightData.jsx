economies is also a tailwind to the global macro backdrop. Central banks will embark on their rate

bonds are expected to fall. In such an environment, high-yield dividend stocks can offer yields that surpass those of CDs and

should be on defensive qualities, which should provide additional
financial headroom in a downturn. High-yield dividend stocks offer
investors flexibility from a reinvestment perspective. Dividends can
be reinvested into additional shares, allowing for the compounding

also look into structures that can provide them an opportunity to participate on the upside of these megacap stocks and the broader market, but can also provide some downside protection in case the recent run-up
