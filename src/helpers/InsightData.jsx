investment option. With the potential to offer higher yields, growing dividends, and capital appreciation, they provide a
compelling alternative to bonds and CDs. Companies that have a consistent and reliable source of income, in the form of
dividends, tend to do well over the long term. These stocks are particularly attractive to investors who are looking for a
combination of regular income and capital appreciation.`,

on companies with above average dividend growth potential with
solid balance sheets. The focus should also be on the quality of the
running income via earnings growth that will underwrite current
dividend payments and future payments. Overall, the emphasis
should be on defensive qualities, which should provide additional
financial headroom in a downturn. High-yield dividend stocks offer
investors flexibility from a reinvestment perspective. Dividends can
be reinvested into additional shares, allowing for the compounding
of returns over time without the need for additional capital. This
strategy can help investors accumulate more shares and increase
their income over time, making high-yield dividend stocks a
compelling choice in a lower-rate environment.`,

term.`,

also look into structures that can provide them an opportunity to participate on the upside of these megacap stocks and the broader market, but can also provide some downside protection in case the recent run-up

favourable versus other safe-haven bonds including German bunds and US Treasuries. The
