      <h2>MODERN SLAVERY POLICY</h2>
      <p>In 2015 new legislation was introduced entitled the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Modern slavery encompasses slavery, servitude, human trafﬁcking and forced labour.</p>
      <p>We are committed to acting ethically, with integrity and transparency in all business dealings and to continually improving our policies and practices in order to safeguard against any form of modern slavery taking place within the business or our supply chain.</p>
      <p>For financial planning firms within Wealthfusion, business activities cover a wide range of financial products and services including financial advice across life and health protection, savings and investments, retirement planning, tax planning and mortgage advice.</p>
      <p>For wealth management firms within Wealthfusion, business activities include the provision of portfolio management and stockbroking services.</p>
      <p>For protection only firms within Wealthfusion, business activities include the provision of financial advice and covers a wide range of protection products.</p>
      <h4>Our policies on slavery and human trafficking</h4>
      <p>Our anti-slavery policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.</p>
      <p>We aim to provide a rewarding working environment in which people are valued and respected. Our policies and procedures aim to ensure that we create a safe and inclusive working environment for our staff. Our employee handbook outlines several policies aimed at employee wellbeing, including:</p>
      <h4>Equal opportunities policy</h4>
      <p>Whistleblowing policy and procedure<br />
        Grievance policy and procedure<br />
        Our supply chains</p>
      <h4>Providers of financial products</h4>
      <p>Recruitment agencies<br />
        Software providers<br />
        Office suppliers<br />
        Third-party consultants<br />
        Supplier adherence to our values</p>
      <p>We have zero-tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values, we will ensure their agreement to comply with our expectations at the outset of our relationship with them.</p>
      <h4>Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking</h4>
      <p>As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, we undertake audit activity in order to:</p>
      <p>Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains<br />
        Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains<br />
        Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains<br />
        The output of this activity will serve as a measure of our effectiveness in combating slavery and human trafficking.</p>
      <h4>Risk</h4>
      <p>The overall risk for the Wealthfusion related to Modern Slavery Act compliance is deemed low for the following reasons:</p>
      <p>Wealthfusion is almost entirely UK based and operates in the ﬁeld of ﬁnancial services<br />
        Our supply chain is limited to goods and services which are required to support an organisation of this nature (e.g. support services and computer hardware/software)<br />
        Use of non-UK based suppliers is limited<br />
        Training<br />
        To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff.</p>
      <p>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.</p>
