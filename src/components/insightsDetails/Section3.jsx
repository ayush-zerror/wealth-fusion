                <p>Formula E has been on a fast track over the past decade, quickly evolving into one of the most gripping motor-racing series, with TV viewership figures of 491 million worldwide, more than a billion impressions across social channels, and a global fanbase of 374 million.</p>
                <p>Given its exposure as the “noisiest quietest” motorsport, it’s important that when racing fans around the world see their racing heroes hold a trophy aloft, the sculpture they hold in their hand embodies the Championship’s race of innovation towards a greener future and an optimum use of resources. Especially when it comes to increasing the global visibility of the sport and its Founding Partner Julius Baer’s commitment to next-generation topics such as electric mobility.</p>
                <h4>The strategy behind the artwork </h4>
                <p>“The Pole Position Winner’s Trophy is one of Julius Baer’s main assets in our partnership with Formula E and we were looking for new ideas on how to develop the trophy for the next generation of the championship,” says Chief Marketing Officer Marco Parroni. “We wanted something sleek and beautiful that also aligned with our principles of sustainable design and manufacture.” </p>
                <p>To make this vision a reality, Julius Baer and Formula E challenged three BA Product and Industrial Design graduates from the prestigious Central Saint Martins University of the Arts in London to come up with a bespoke design for the all-electric car series. The concept selected, ‘Dance with Strategy’ by design graduate Cassorde Zafari, aimed to embody the balance between variables like speed, timing, energy management and practical awareness, all of which influence the outcome of a race.</p>
                <p>For Cassorde, the main challenge was finding the right narrative for the design. “I wanted to bring the research I took from qualifying formats into a physical form. ‘Dance with Strategy’ is about the precision of teamwork, strategy and driving perfection. It was important for me to shine a light onto the other aspects of racing, where it’s not just about the driver having a perfect line but also the engineering aspect and the pit crews.” </p>
                <h4>Moving from waste to beauty</h4>
                <p>The work of turning Cassorde’s prototype into a sleek sculpture fell to Gomi, a UK design agency with a philosophy of using waste plastics and second-life batteries to make beautiful products that last. “We’re all about taking the material that no one wants and turning it into something that everybody wants,” explains Tom Meades, designer and co-founder of Gomi.</p>
                <p>When Tom and his fellow designers and engineers first received Cassorde’s design, its shape and the combination of materials posed a conundrum. “The concept was very abstract compared with some of the projects we’ve done before,” he says. “The biggest challenges in manufacturing the trophy were moulding the plastic parts to fit onto the metal part. The metal parts are milled and cut down to the nearest micron, but the plastic is a waste material, so inherently it warps and moves. We had to marry those two processes together to create something that was really premium and desirable.”</p>
